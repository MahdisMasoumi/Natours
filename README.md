# Natours
Coded along as part of "Advanced CSS and Sass" course on Udemy: This particular project presents a responsive landing page that caters to the needs of a fictional adventure tour company called Natours. The HTML file follows the latest HTML5 standards, while the CSS file contains the layout and styling information for the page. The project features engaging effects, such as the heading text sliding in from the left and right, achieved through keyframe animations. Furthermore, Google Fonts and icon-fonts were incorporated to enhance the design. Modern CSS techniques like gradient backgrounds, clip-path, and animations were also used to make the layout responsive and adaptable to different devices. The project's visually appealing design showcases the latest CSS techniques in use.
